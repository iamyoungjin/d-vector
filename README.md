##### After plan

0. Solve the issue about enroll.py 'Jens_Stoltenberg'`s 225th file feature extraction disconnecting (I limitied it now and have to change the test data cause i have tested with train data just for check).

1. data argumentation with noise.
2. test with various network and various way of feature embedding.
